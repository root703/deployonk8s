To complete the task, follow these steps on the provided Ubuntu instance:

1. Install Git:
   If Git is not already installed, you can install it using the package manager:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install git
   ```

2. Configure Git with the name and email:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "awsome"
   git config --global user.email "awsome@hackajob.co"
   ```

3. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hackajob/git-challenge /root/git-challenge
   ```

4. Change directory to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd /root/git-challenge
   ```

5. Delete the remote with name "origin":

   ```bash
   git remote rm origin
   ```

6. Add the remote "origin" back pointing to the local repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin /root/git-challenge/.git
   ```

7. Check out to the "challenge" branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout challenge
   ```

8. Create a new file "hello.world" (you can use any text editor of your choice):

   ```bash
   echo "Hello, world!" > hello.world
   ```

9. Commit and push the newly created file:

   ```bash
   git add hello.world
   git commit -m "First Commit!"
   git push origin challenge
   ```

10. Checkout back to the "main" branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

11. Apply the changes from the "challenge" branch to the "main" branch:

    ```bash
    git merge challenge
    ```

12. Push the changes to the "main" branch:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

Now, the changes made in the "challenge" branch have been merged into the "main" branch and pushed to the remote repository.
